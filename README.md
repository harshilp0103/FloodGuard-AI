# FloodGuard AI


## Overview 
FloodGuard AI is an application that helps users receive flood-related information and stay safe within the Santa Clara County.

## Why FloodGuard AI

Floodguard AI aimes to address the critical need for flood awareness and prepardness in San Jose, a region that has been experiencing more rainfall each year. The project focuses on providing real-time flood related data and resources, empowering users to make informed decisions during flood events and enhancing community resilience. 

Key Features: 
- Real-time Flood Data: Offers users live updates on flooding locations through an interactive map, helping them identify and respond to flood-prone areas quickly.
- Flood Safety Information: Summarizes flood-related articles using generative AI, providing concise, actionable insights to improve awareness and preparedness.
- Accessible and Intuitive Design: Built on Streamlit, the platform ensures user-friendly navigation and reliable information storage with a CSV-based system for persistent data.

Unique Approach:
Unlike generic flood-tracking apps, FloodGuard AI integrates real-time mapping with personalized AI-generated summaries of flood safety articles. This dual functionality not only equips users with the tools to track flooding but also educates them on best practices for flood preparedness, making it a holistic solution for flood-related challenges.

Future Vision:
In the long term, FloodGuard AI can be scaled to other regions, addressing flood-related risks on a broader scale. Additional features, such as predictive flood modeling and community reporting tools, will further enhance its impact in mitigating the effects of natural disasters.

## Project Summary

The FloodGuard AI project was designed to provide Silicon Valley residents with accessible flood-related information and real-time flood reporting capabilities. My primary contributions included developing the first feature, which involved extracting critical information from user-provided URLs, and implementing the flood reporting map, allowing users to input street addresses and upload flood-related images for display on a dynamically updated map.

One of the challenges we encountered was selecting an appropriate storage solution for the flood map. Initially, we explored a free online database management system but faced integration issues, prompting a temporary shift to a CSV-based solution.

This project aims to educate users about flooding through a user-friendly interface, empowering individuals with knowledge and tools to safeguard themselves and their families during emergencies. FloodGuard AI stands out as a practical and innovative solution to enhance community preparedness and resilience.
